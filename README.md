# Sprint Doctor

## Overview
Jira is a standard — and a pain.

Teams complain about:
- Slow loading, laggy UI
- Feature overload
- Massive backlogs with dead tickets
- Complex workflows only admins can modify

Sprint Doctor is a keyboard-driven layer over Jira that’s as fast as Linear but keeps enterprise compatibility.

## The Problem
- **UI/UX Pain**: Click-heavy, slow, cluttered
- **Context Loss**: Tickets created without “why”
- **Formatting Bugs**: Copy/paste ruins structure
- **Pointless Fields**: Users game the system just to move tickets

## Why This Is Still Unsolved
- Jira backlog is massive — even Atlassian can’t fix it.
- Admin permissions gate real customization.
- Product leaders focus on charts over dev speed.

## Vision
- Sub-second ticket actions
- AI-powered backlog cleanup
- Git → Jira linkage for better context

## Core Capabilities
1. **Terminal/CLI UI for Jira**
2. **Backlog Auditor AI**
3. **Slack/GitHub Workspace Sync**

## Example Questions
- Why was this created?
- Which bugs haven’t moved in 3 months?
- What’s our true velocity excluding meetings?

## Inputs
- Jira API, Slack/Teams, Git commits

## Outputs
- Lightning-fast views, smart status updates, backlog health

## Risks
- Jira API limits speed
- Admin permission blockers

## Ideal Users
- Dev-first orgs stuck with Jira
- Teams who crave keyboard speed

## Why This Is Ambitious
Aims to be the “Superhuman” for Jira — better UX on top of slow legacy infra.

## Name Story

Japanese bullet train — legendary speed + precision for Jira workflows.
